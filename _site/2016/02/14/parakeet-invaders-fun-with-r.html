	<p>How do species evolve invasive traits? Do species appropriate pre-existing traits to become successful invaders? What roles do human human disturbance and phenotypic plasticity play in successful biological invasions? These are long-standing questions in the field of invasion biology. In my PhD research, I&#39;m addressing these questions by studying an invasive parakeet species.</p>

<p>The order <em>Psittaciformes</em> contains some of the highest numbers of endangered avian species. On the other hand, we see more parrot invaders than expected by chance. Monk parakeets (<em>Myiopsitta monachus</em>), native to South America, have been dispersed across the Northern hemisphere by the global pet trade. This species is widely successful across its introduced range, even in areas colder than the native range. Introduced populations live largely in cities, and this affinity for human-disturbed habitat may have arisen in the native range. Native populations are thought to have expanded their range in the late 1800s, when wide swathes of Argentina were converted for agricultural purposes. </p>

<p>I&#39;m using genomic tools to determine if genetic differentiation patterns across monk parakeet populations are a product of adaptation to human-induced selection pressures. I&#39;m complementing genomic markers with candidate immune genes to determine if human disturbance influences pathogenic selection pressures. I&#39;m also interested in cold adaptations and phenotypic plasticity, including learning, in monk parakeets that evolved much earlier than their contemporary invasions.</p>

<p>In the following posts, I&#39;ll use monk parakeets when playing around in: </p>
