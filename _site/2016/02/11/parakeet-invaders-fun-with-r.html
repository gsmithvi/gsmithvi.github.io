	<p>How do species evolve invasive traits? Do species appropriate pre-existing traits to become successful invaders? What roles do human human disturbance and phenotypic plasticity play in successful biological invasions? These are long-standing questions in the field of invasion biology. In my PhD research, I&#39;m addressing these questions by studying an invasive parakeet species.</p>

<p>Psittaciformes contains some of the highest numbers of endangered avian species. On the other hand, we see more parrot invaders than expected by chance. Monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), native to South America, have been dispersed across the Northern hemisphere by the global pet trade. This species is widely successful across its introduced range, even in areas colder than the native range. Introduced populations live largely in cities, and native populations are thought to have expanded their range in the late 1800s, when native land in South America was converted for agriculture. </p>

<p>I&#39;m using genomic tools to determine if genetic differentiation patterns across native and invasive populations have arisen due to:
*demographic differences (different and/or multiple origins for introduced populations) *adaptation to selection pressures prior to introduction (e.g., in the native range)
*adaptation to selection pressures post-introduction</p>

<p>In my genomic project, I generated restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) libraries across native and invasive populations. My purpose is two-fold: 
*to examine population structure with finer resolution than traditional population genetics approaches
*to determine if any RAD markers show signatures of selection 
RAD-seq is not targeted towards specific genes, but instead returns areas of the genome near restriction enzyme sites. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also targeting candidate genes to determine whether human disturbance influences selection pressures in monk parakeet populations. Diseases, or pathogenic selection pressures, can leave signatures in immune system genes. I&#39;m genotyping individuals at toll-like receptors, genes of the innate immune system that are the first responders to bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in cold adaptations and phenotypic plasticity in monk parakeets that evolved much earlier than their contemporary invasions. Beaks are a major surface for heat exchange, as are periophthalmic rings (naked skin around the eye). Like the extinct Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis), monk parakeets have feathered ceres (or nostrils, for those unfamiliar with birds). Monk parakeets have smaller eye-rings than other South American parrots of similar body size. Monks are also among the only parrots that construct nests. These multi-chambered communal provide a thermal buffer against the cold. </p>

<p>Monk parakeets are a very cool system. Like most parrots, this species is well known for open-ended learning, or the ability to learn throughout their lives. It&#39;s likely that learning, a form of phenotypic plasticity, plays an important role in monk parakeet invasions. Studies of invasive parrots can yield important findings for invasion biology, and contribute to our understanding of parrots&#39; natural histories.</p>

<p>In the following posts, I&#39;ll use monk parakeets as a case study for playing around in R. </p>
